                            unique homemade items. This option is a little more time intensive but it offers the best

        <h3>Additional Information</h3>
        <p>01. Selling Requirements</p>
        <div class="panel-body">
            For a costume to be sold on Chrysalis it needs to be in excellent condition.
            We donâ€™t expect perfection, very slight wear is acceptable, but the costume must be complete,
            with no defects or flaws that could compromise utility for the next owner.
        </div>

        <p>02. Cleanliness Requirements</p>
        <div class="panel-body">
            Costumes sold directly to other users need to be clean and ready to be worn.
            Costumes sent to Chrysalis are inspected and cleaned prior to resale.
            However, we do not accept excessively dirty costumes with obvious stains or odors.
        </div>

        <p>
            03. Request a Bag
        </p>
        <div class="panel-body">
            In order for us to have a chance to offer you a payout you need
            to have at least three costumes to request a costume cleanout kit.
            These costumes need to pass our cleanliness and selling requirements.
        </div>

        <p>04. Upload a Costume - Photo Guide</p>
        <div class="panel-body">
            The easiest way to upload photos is to use the Chrysalis app.
            You can also upload the photos on our site. We recommend taking a few photos showing
            the entire costume as well as a detail photo showing any spots
            with wear or minor flaws, or any accessories.
            As a general rule, do not photograph anything that is not included with the costume.
        </div>

        <p>05. Chrysalis' Referral Program</p>
        <div class="panel-body">
            If you believe in our vision help us make it a reality.
            Get your friends and family members to send us a Costume Cleanout Kit
            and both of you get $5 worth of Chrysalis Store Credit.
        </div>

        <p>
            06. How Does Chrysalis Profit?
        </p>
        <div class="panel-body">
            We charge a 3% transaction fee for every user uploaded costume.
            We also make a small margin on costumes we resell.
